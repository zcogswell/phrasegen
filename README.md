# Phrase Generator
This is a script to generate XKCD style passphrases, but includes mixed case words, numbers, and symbols.
This is not intended to be used for any password.
For passwords entered infrequently, a standard random string password generator with a manager is better.
This is intended for passwords that should be very difficult to brute force, but memorable enough to not require a password manager.

## Requirements
*nix based OS
